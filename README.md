# proxmox-env-terraform
## Description
This repository is used as a reference for my home lab setup with Proxmox and Terraform.
## Usage
After updating passwords and endpoints, you will also need the template for cloudinit created. See https://danstechjourney.com/proxmox-with-terraform
  
After it's all setup run:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
